Lab 1 was done in the meeting on 12/11. 
A completed lab should look like this and include all of these files:

You may upload Lab 1 as well if you want. Don't be afraid to text us on remind or email us if you have any questions. Good luck on coding your first neural network.

This is the link to access Lab 1: https://colab.research.google.com/github/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/Part1_TensorFlow.ipynb

This is the link to access Lab 2: https://colab.research.google.com/github/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb

For both labs, we recommend to make copies of each of them in your own drive.

After you are done, using the fork you've made in github, make sure to copy the file you've made over to github. Doing this will result in the completed lab picture above.
